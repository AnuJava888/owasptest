There are many security vulnerabilities for the application like SQL injection , CrossSiteScripting (XSS), 
broken authentication and session management,insecure direct object references,
and cross site request forgery.

ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes
it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications.

In this project I have used and  tested the various security control interfaces provided by the api to see if they effectively
eliminate the security vulnerabilities from the code.
